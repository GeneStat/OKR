# OKR ([Objectives and Key Results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR))

This repository (OKR of GeneStat team) helps us focus on scientific research and keep moving forward. This is a totally new attempt for us, using software developing principles and methods on a scientific research project. We will try our best to achieve our goal and record the whole procedure.

## Two-Year OKR

**Objective**: Build a qualified and experienced open scientific research team.

**Key Results**:

* Read at least one hundred scientific papers to know the cutting-edge of the target field well.
* Repeat the analysis procedure of at least three high-quality computational research papers.
* Public at least one peer-reviewed scientific research paper.

## Recent Plan

* Read at least ten related papers every month.
* Find at least three topics to study in the next two months (before Dec 31, 2021), and then choose one to focus on.
* Collect data, analyze, and prepare a thesis next year (before Dec 31, 2022).

## Tracking Log
